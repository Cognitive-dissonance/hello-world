# hello-world
my first attempt at manually creating a repo

will these file types and from within this git editor, accept an image-paste?

Like this:  

seems unsucessful, but one more try, wth: 

NICE!  i have to say, that a pet peeve pretty much since graphics came onto the net has been, for me, that I type a ton of stuff into a field, message, etc, and go to do one little thing that takes me to another page, and when I hit the back button, my entire message (sometimes many hours) was just gone. *poof* nadda. I just tried to view a trivial image on this page to copy-paste it, and it told me I may lose my message if i do that and do i wanna cancle or go ahead. not bein' familiar with this setup i cancelled, and will get my alternate-test-paste image from another window and attempt to paste above. (unhopefully, however...) and...... nope. probably just a plain text file.

Write a bit about myself, eh?  Heh... 

The Biography of a boy/man, from his first memories, to the following tragic ~48 years, and a brief-ish summary of the next couple of years after he had removed suicide from his list of options interestingly close to the time he started watching Sam Harris on you-tool^H^H^Hube, then checking out Sam's websites a couple months later, signing up for both, and started using Sam's waking up meditation app more consistently, and much longer than any of the dozens he's tried - TM (don't bother! - unless it 5 or 10 bucks), books, tapes, (VHS & audio cassette) in the last few decades. Those two little girls of his have NO CLUE how incredibly lucky they are. I might give a limb to meet him for a fwe days.. and one of the things he talks about is AI and the potential End of the Human Race as we know it. I've been programming since '78, and took a number of college courses on AI in the mid to late 80's.

Chapter 1. It was a dark and stormy night...

whoops.. that'd probably take a month or two - for this hour or two intro tutorial, i think I'll skip that one.  ;)
